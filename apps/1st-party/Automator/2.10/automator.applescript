(*
	Previously Bloody Flaky. Let's see if it has improved. This script creates
	an app for the user and stores it in /Applications/AppleScript folder. A
	code template is hard coded in the body of this script.

	@Requires:
		clipboard.applescript - Some input fields could not be manipulated directly so the clipboard is utilized.

	@Project:
		applescript-core

	@Build:
		make build-automator

	WARNING:
		Assumes automator is not used or opened for purposes other than the exclusive use of this script.
		Wipes out clipboard contents.

	@Last Modified: 2024-07-22 23:10:27

	@Change Logs:
		Fri, Jul 19, 2024 at 2:40:35 PM - Refactored to use simpler script wrapped in an app.
