(*
	@Purpose:
		The original safari script is quite big and we want to improve its manageability by breaking it down into smaller pieces.
		This decorator will contain the handlers relating tab finding.

	@Project:
		applescript-core

	@Build:
		./scripts/build-lib.sh apps/1st-party/Safari/17.5/dec-safari-tab-finder
