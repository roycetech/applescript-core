(*
	This app picks up the current loaded file in Script Editor and creates a 
	stay open app, the updates the plist file so that the app doesn't show in 
	the dock while running.
	This app is created for menu-type stay open apps because doing it via 
	osacompile breaks the app.
	
	@Deployment:
		Run "Create Automator App" while this script is loaded in Script Editor.
		Grant Accessibility permission to the generated app.
	
	@Testing Notes
		Open the Menu Case.applescript and that will be used to test this script.
