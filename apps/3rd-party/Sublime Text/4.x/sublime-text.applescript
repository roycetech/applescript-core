(*
	The app Sublime Text behaves differently as compared to first party Apple apps in terms of how it handles its windows. 
	Each individual project tabs are not treated as separate windows as compared to first party apps.

	@Usage:
       	set st to std's import("sublime-text")'s new  -- Text Expander: "sset st"
		
	@Installation:
		From this sub-directory, run: `make install`

	@Known Issues:
		The handler isCurrentFileNewUnsaved is broken when the front window does 
		not have a saved project.


 	NOTE: if AXDocument is missing, usually when filename is missing value then restart Sublime Text.
