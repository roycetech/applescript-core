(*
	WIP:
		Working for bottom dock only. To do the sides as needed.

	@Purpose:
		Provide handlers that will detect window overlap to the dock

	@Suggestion for window positioning configuration:
		1. Save window position with the dock hidden.
		2. When the dock is not hidden and overlapp is detected, reduce the height of the offending window.

	@Project:
		applescript-core

	@Build:
		./scripts/build-lib.sh core/decorators/dec-process-dock-aware
